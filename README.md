# About This Repository

This repository is made so that I can create my first project which is a recipe website. In this website I will put all my HTML & GIT knowledge into practice, which I have learned from ['The Odin Project'](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## About This Project

By profession, I am a billing officer in the accounts department of a textile industry. So creating a website is out of my business and very difficult for me, but now learning web development has become my hobby & passion, so I am struggling to learn it. 

When I started my project, I spent a whole day in just thinking about, how do I create this website and from where I do start making ?

+ First I started searching google to get ideas for the recipes and looked the contents of recipes in various websites.
+ Then I looked at projects submitted by others to [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/781/project_submissions).
+ After that, I came up with an idea that I should create the recipe website of my favorite foods.
+ I chose 10 recipes of my favorite foods for this website.
+ Then I google the recipes contents and collect them to put in my first website.

## How I build this recipe website?

Creating a website was a new experience for me, so I had faced a lot of trouble while making this website but I did not give up.

1. First I re-read the TOP lessons, so that I can figure out where to start the HTML coding.
2. I also did google search to recap the HTML basics for better understanding.
3. When I started to make this recipe website practically, many HTML concepts have began to be better understood in my mind.
4. I learned something permanent about HTML elements, when I practically created my first webpage 'index.html' and 'arab-kofta-pulao.html' and link both of them each other.
5. I feels so much powerful and talk to myself that Wow, Irfan, now you have really become a web developer.
6. During the building of each new webpage, I googled for new HTML elements to customize my content and doing so increased my skills and knowledge of HTML language.
7. And finally I finished my project with a website of 10 recipes.

## What else I learned besides HTML?

From the beginning of 'Lesson 1' to the 'HTML recipe project'. I've learned a lot things in between that I didn't know before.

+ **Ubuntu** <br> I did not use the LINUX operating system before I joined the classes with [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/). In my country, Microsoft Windows Operating System is used everywhere from home computers to industrial computers. I am also an addict user of Microsoft Windows, but since WINDOWS is not natively supported by [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/) as they highly recommend to use the Mac or Linux, so I had to choose the Linux as this is the only option available to me for my Lenovo Thinkpad Laptop.
    + I learned how to install Ubuntu and successfully installed it in my laptop.
    + I also learned how to use the 'terminal' in Ubuntu, such as the 'command prompt' used in windows.
    + The user interface of UBUNTU is not as flexible as WINDOWS, but its 'terminal' is more powerful than 'command prompt' in windows and this is what I liked most in Ubuntu.
    + I can't imagine that I resized 24 images in a terminal with just one line command and my work was done in seconds. It's not as easy in windows as it is in ubuntu.
    + Another interesting thing about Linux which I realized is that most of the softwares developed for linux are free of cost. If you can, you should donate to developers to make the software more powerful for you & for the whole linux community.
    + I have now started learning about Ubuntu through online platforms, so that I can get used to it as soon as possible.

    <br>

+ **GIT & GitHub** <br> I have never heard of this powerful tool before. I came to know about the GIT tool & GitHub repository during the [foundation course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) of TOP. 
    + I have learned how to setup git in local machine and how to create a remote repository in Github.
    + I have experimented with how to connect a local repository in your machine to a remote repository on github cloud service.
    + I have also learned the basic workflow command of GIT tools used in terminal.
    + Github also provide the feature of Live Preview of your projects.
    + Overall conclusion is that it is a very impressive tool that can track the changes of the source code of your websites.
<br>
<br>

+ **Visual Studio Code Editor** <br> I have also experimented with Visual Studio Code Editor as a tool to create my first project. This editor makes coding much easier. I like it the most.
<br>
<br>

+ **GIMP** <br> GIMP is not the part of [TOP Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), but when I was creating my first project I needed to edit some images.  I mostly use 'Adobe Photoshop' in windows to make some basic edits to images and photos, but it is not available officially for Linux. So, I googled the alternative to 'Adobe Photoshop' and found out that GIMP is the best alternative in Linux. <br>
I used GIMP to edit some of the images for my first project. Its interface is also not as flexible as 'Adobe Photoshop' but there may be a reason, I am not accustomed to its interface. I am also learning GIMP in addition to 'The Odin Project Course' because I think it will be useful in future for my web development career.
