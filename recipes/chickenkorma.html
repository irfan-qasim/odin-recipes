    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>Chicken Korma is prepared by marinating and then braising a meat 
        in a yogurt or cream base. The dish is traditionally cooked 
        on low heat for around an hour until the meat is tender and 
        the sauce turns into a rich and creamy glaze.</p>

        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h4>STEPS</h4>

    <ol>
        <strong><li>Make the almond paste:</li></strong>
        <p>Soak the almonds in 1/2 cup water for approximately 2 hours. Peel the skins off. In a blender (I use Nutribullet) grind the almonds into a smooth paste. Feel free to add 1-2 tablespoons of additional water to help with a smooth grinding.</p>

        <strong><li>Marinade the chicken:</li></strong>
            <p>In a medium-sized mixing bowl combine yogurt, turmeric, ginger garlic paste, salt, and cayenne pepper. Using a spoon or a whisk, mix it all together. Add chicken to the marinade. Coat the chicken well with marinade. Cover with a plate and set aside in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Fry the onions:</li></strong>
            <p>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Line a plate or sheet pan with paper towels and set this near the stove. Check to see if the oil is hot enough by dropping a strand of onion into the pot. If it sizzles then the oil is ready. Add the rest of the onions to the pot.</p>
            <p>Cook for 7-10 minutes on medium-high heat while moving them around until the onions turn golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to take the onions out of the oil and spread into the paper-towel-lined plate or sheet pan lined to soak up the excess oil.</p>
            <p>Set aside for later. You will use these onions to make a paste. Leave about 1 tablespoon of oil in the pot and discard the rest.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Start cooking the chicken:</li></strong>
            <p>Add cardamom, peppercorn, cinnamon, cloves, and bay leaf to the pot with the oil and reduce the heat to medium. Gently stir. Add chicken, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5-8 minutes, until the chicken turns opaque.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Make the onion paste:</li></strong>
            <p>In a blender or food processor, add the fried onions and a couple of tablespoons of water. Pulse until it becomes a coarse paste.</p>
            <p>Add the fried onion paste, salt, and coriander to the pot with the chicken. Mix everything together. Cover and let it simmer for 5-8 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.</p>

        <strong><li>Finish the dish:</li></strong>
            <p>Remove the lid, and add the yogurt, almond paste, and shredded coconut (if using). Stir well. Cook on medium-high heat (uncovered) for another 2-3 minutes, until the sauce turns creamy and oil starts to separate.</p>
            <strong><em>Garnish with almonds and cilantro. Serve with hot naan or lachcha paratha.</em></strong>
