    <h1>BEEF HALEEM RECIPE</h1>
    <img src="../images/beef-haleem.jpg" alt="Beef Haleem Picture">

    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>Haleem is a paste-like stew composed of meat (mutton, beef or chicken), pounded wheat, lentils, ghee, ginger-garlic paste and turmeric. It also contains spices such as cumin seeds, caraway seeds, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, black pepper, saffron and jaggery, and dry fruits such as pistachio, cashew, fig and almond. It is served hot, topped with a ghee-based gravy, pieces of lime, chopped coriander and fried onions as garnish.</p>
    <p>It is made by soaking wheat, barley and gram lentil overnight, and a spicy meat gravy is prepared to make the meat tender. The wheat, barley and gram are boiled in salt water, and then mixed with the meat gravy and blended with heavy wooden paddles or hand mashers to obtain a sticky-smooth, paste-like consistency. The cooking procedure takes about 6-7 hours over a low firewood flame.</p>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <p><h4><strong>Meat, Wheat, Lentils, Onions, Ginger, Garlic, Yogurt, Spices, Herbs, Oil and Ghee.</strong></h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> Lamb, goat or beef is traditional. But you can try chicken or veal too. I like to use meat with bones for extra flavor. If you use boneless meat, try to use stock as the cooking liquid.</li>
        <li><strong>Grains:</strong> Traditional recipes use whole soft-wheat grains sold as “haleem wheat” at Indian grocery stores. But you can use cracked wheat that is widely available. I also like to add pearl barley as it gives a nice consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Lentils:</strong> Use a combination of dehusked Indian lentils, such as, channa dal (split baby chickpeas), masoor dal (red lentils), moong dal (split mung beans) and urad dal (split black lentils).</li>
        <li><strong>Spices:</strong> Garam masala, ground coriander, ground cumin, chili powder, turmeric, ground black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Herbs:</strong> Cilantro, mint</li>
        <li><strong>Oil and Ghee:</strong> I like to use an oil with high smoking point for frying the onions. A drizzle of grass fed ghee will make this dish taste wonderful.</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon:</strong> I don’t like to stir in lemon juice while cooking. Serve it on the side to use as per taste.</li>
    </ul>
