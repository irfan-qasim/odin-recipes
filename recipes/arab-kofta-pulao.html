    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>Arabian kofta pulao is a famous Arab recipe. 
        It involves first preparing meatballs and then cooking rice pulao 
        and then serving with usual add-ons like raita, salad and chutney. 
        Kofta is the specialty of the dish; you can use either chicken or mutton, 
        whichever suits your situation. After eating so many types of pulao,

        that you have been missing yet.</p>
